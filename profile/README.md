## About Us  
Geophysics is broadly defined as the quantitative study of the physical Earth. While there are a diverse number of sub-disciplines within the field including seismology, tectonophysics, and geodesy, geophysics is united in how physics and mathematics are applied to increase our understanding of conditions and processes within the Earth system. Most students who pursue careers in geophysics share some common attributes including the perseverance to deal with complex problems, the patience to deal with confusing data, a knack for applied mathematics, an interest in computers, and a love for the outdoors. If you can identify with several of these attributes, then geophysics may be the field of study for you.

The Geophysics group at the University of Oregon consists of a collection of faculty, staff scientists, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students within the Department of Earth Sciences who share a common interest in geophysical problems. We hold regular meetings to discuss contemporary topics and share results from current research. The diversity of specialties represented by the membership helps to broaden the groupâ€™s exposure to fundamental issues and enrich internal discussions.
